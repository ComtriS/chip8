Chip-8 Emulator

== Requirements ==
- gcc
- posix
 
== Compilation ==
 - make

== Running ==
 - ./bin/chip8 ./roms/INVADERS   # or any other rom
 - The original Chip-8 computers used a hexadecimal keypad with the following layout:
 
 > 1 2 3 C

 > 4 5 6 D
 
 > 7 8 9 E
 
 > A 0 B F

 - The keys above are mapped to the same keys on your keyboard (which makes playing some games painful)
